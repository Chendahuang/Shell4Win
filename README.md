Shell4Win
=========

A Windows shell interpreter accepting shell commands and shell scripts
 
Reason for Shell4Win
=========

As a former UNIX administrator,I think batch's syntaxes are very strange and difficult to use.
Some arguments in batch are both hard to imagine and easy to produce mistakes
<br/ >
I'm tired of this and decide to write a interpreter which can accept shell commands and scripts,
just like shell under UNIX, which is more clean and easy to use.

Who would like Shell4Win
=========

If you conform to following issues, you may find Shell4Win very effective and convenient for you
<ul>
<li>1. Familiar with UNIX/Linux shell and don't like batch's syntax</li>
<li>2. Use windows and in need of automating many every day jobs in your projects</li>
<li>3. Value your own time very much :)</li>
</ul>
Why not python
=========

shell is much easier to learn and can already solve many many simple tasks very well. It won't be necessary to use python in many cases.
<br/ >
In fact I'm a fan of python and I believe python can help people improve their productivity to a great extent, so if you want to solve some complicated jobs, I will recommend python.
