Shell4Win
=========

A Windows shell interpreter accepting shell commands and shell scripts

Reason for Shell4Win
=========

As a former UNIX administrator, I find batch commands under windows too messy and don't always act as expected. 
I'm tired of that and decide to write a interpreter which can accept shell commands and scripts, just like shell under UNIX, which is more clean and easy to use.

Who would like Shell4Win
=========

If you conform to following issues, you may find Shell4Win very effective and convenient for you
1. Familiar with UNIX/Linux shell and don't like batch's syntax
2. Use windows and in need of automating many every day jobs in your projects
3. Value your own time very much :)

Why not python
=========

shell is much easier to learn and can already solve many many simple tasks very well. It won't be necessary to use python in many cases.In fact I'm a fan of python and I believe python can help people improve their productivity to a great extent, so if you want to solve some complicated jobs, I will recommend python.
