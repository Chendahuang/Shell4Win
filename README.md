Shell4Win
=========

Shell4Win is a <b>shell interpreter</b> accepting UNIX/Linux style shell commands and shell scripts,it enables you to use shell on windows platform. it realised many important features of shell,including pipes,colon seperating commands in one line and redirection <br/ >
As a former UNIX administrator, batch is a little too messy for me and I have wasted too much time on its strange syntaxes and arguments.
If you happen to be familiar with shell and have to deal with Windows from now and then,There is a great chance you will like Shell4Win
<br/ >

How to get 
=========

<a href="https://github.com/log4leo/Shell4Win/archive/master.zip">Download</a> zip files and all executables can be found in the bin directory.


How to use
=========

Shell4Win.exe in the bin directory is our main program,double click and you can get an interactive window where you can type in any <a href="#available-commands">available commands</a>. <br />
Shell4Win is also capable of explaining shell scripts by typing in <a href="#examples">sh example.sh</a>

Available Commands
=========

Shell4Win realised many commands in common use and the list of available commands keeps growing.
[echo,cd,ls,cat,rm,grep,wc,mkdir,touch,cp,mv,read,sh,diff...]

Some Special Things in Shell4Win
=========

* Do the same thing to directory and file
Since I don't enough time to add arguments support for every command, So Shell4Win regards files and directories as the same thing in many cases. e.g rm 1 will remove 1 no matter it is a file or directory, it works the same with other similar commands like cp mv and so on

Dependecies
=========

Shell4Win uses following third party tools:
* [ply](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/):generate lexical analyzer and syntax analyzer
* [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/):generate executable exe files on Windows
